    <p>Hi everyone. I am from São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. Now I am 59 years old and have been married for 37 years. I have six children and two grandchildren.</p>
    <p>I already work as a software developer. My academic background is a bachelor's degree in Business Administration. I also have a postgraduate degree in Business Management and Technology.</p>
    <p>The certificates I want to achieve are in Applied Technology. My purpose in continuing my studies is to keep up to date, and to gain competence in areas where I am weak.</p>
    <p>I am a convert of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was 18 years old. One important thing in the doctrine for me is that we have to trust in God.</p>
    <p>Although I have a lot of experience in systems development, I need to develop new skills and I'm excited to do that with you.</p>
