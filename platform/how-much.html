<!--                    The cost of using the FASTBIZZ platform is lower than the cost of maintaining a traditional business. Every business process has its cost. To have a course provided on the web, a producer would need to hire a web designer to assemble the course into a suitable format. This represents a high and significant upfront cost, before you have revenue. He would need to spend to host the course permanently on a website.-->
                    The cost of using the FASTBIZZ platform is lower than the cost of maintaining a traditional business. If you've ever done budget planning, you know how much it costs to start and maintain a business. With FastBizz, you have no fixed costs, just a usage fee that is charged on each sale.</p>

                In a traditional operation, the costs could reach 50% of the sale value. With a platform, this cost is around 10%, which is the market average. The cost of FASTBIZZ follows the market standard, with the difference that we add value in serving the producer.
