                <p>
                    The cost of using the FASTBIZZ platform is lower than the cost of maintaining a traditional business. Every business process has its cost. To have a course provided on the web, a producer would need to hire a web designer to assemble the course into a suitable format. This represents a high and significant upfront cost, before you have revenue. He would need to spend to host the course permanently on a website.

            <p>
                The billing service would need to be done by some tool via the web or by hiring an assistant to do it. A program or a person would need to verify all purchases and their respective payments in order to generate access for each purchaser. Then managing buyer access would be an additional and costly job.

                A platform for digital products encompasses all processes at a lower cost. Without the platform, costs could reach 50% of the sale value. With a platform, this cost is around 10%, which is the market average. The cost of FASTBIZZ follows the market standard, with the difference that it adds value in serving the producer.
