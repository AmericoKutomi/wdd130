                    FASTBIZZ is a platform for people who want to offer services on the Web. Many people have knowledge and skills that they could share with others for a fee. Many of them managed to make it a source of income. Some give private lessons, in courses or in schools. However, they are limited by the amount of time available. In recent years, a large number of people have offered video-recorded courses over the Internet. Many of these people are getting a sizable and ongoing source of income. They are called digital producers. FASTBIZZ is a platform for digital producers.

                    FASTBIZZ provides resources for the main processes in business. The producers create products in the platform by informing its name, description, and the contents. For example, for a product like a course, the contents can be the modules and the lessons, with their texts and videos. After creating the product, the producer informs the prices and promotions that will be used in the selling. The producer will have the sales page provided by the platform. The promotion of the page is done by the producer himself through social networks and digital marketing actions.  The buyer enters the sales page and is able to make the payment. The platform confirms receipt and automatically generates access to the product for the buyer. The buyer receives the platform and product access credentials and starts consuming. In the case of courses, the buyer will see the modules, lessons and videos that the producer has prepared for him. Thus, FASTBIZZ makes an idea tangible in a product and makes business processes viable.
