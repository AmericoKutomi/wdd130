      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        FASTBIZZ is a platform for people who want to offer services on the Web. Many people have knowledge and skills that they could share with others for a fee. Many of them managed to make it a source of income. Some give private lessons, in courses or in schools. However, they are limited by the amount of time available. In recent years, a large number of people have offered video-recorded courses over the Internet. Many of these people are getting a sizable and ongoing source of income. They are called digital producers. FASTBIZZ is a platform for digital producers.
      </p>
      <h4>How it works</h4>
      <p>
        FASTBIZZ provides resources for the main processes in business. The producers create products in the platform by informing its name, description, and the contents. For example, for a product like a course, the contents can be the modules and the lessons, with their texts and videos. After creating the product, the producer informs the prices and promotions that will be used in the selling. The producer will have the sales page provided by the platform. The promotion of the page is done by the producer himself through social networks and digital marketing actions.  The buyer enters the sales page and is able to make the payment. The platform confirms receipt and automatically generates access to the product for the buyer. The buyer receives the platform and product access credentials and starts consuming. In the case of courses, the buyer will see the modules, lessons and videos that the producer has prepared for him. Thus, FASTBIZZ makes an idea tangible in a product and makes business processes viable.
      </p>
      <h4>Differential: Costs and Personalized Service</h4>
      <p>
        FastBizz offers cost compatible with the market, but offers a personalized service to the producer.  See more on How Much and Personalized Service.

      </ul>
      <h3>How Much</h3>
      <h4>Processes costs</h4>
      <p>
        The cost of using the FASTBIZZ platform is lower than the cost of maintaining a traditional business. Every business process has its cost. To have a course provided on the web, a producer would need to hire a web designer to assemble the course into a suitable format. This represents a high and significant upfront cost, before you have revenue. He would need to spend to host the course permanently on a website. The billing service would need to be done by some tool via the web or by hiring an assistant to do it. A program or a person would need to verify all purchases and their respective payments in order to generate access for each purchaser. Then managing buyer access would be an additional and costly job. Thus, a platform for digital products encompasses all processes at a lower cost. Without the platform, costs could reach 50% of the sale value. With a platform, this cost is around 10%, which is the market average. The cost of FASTBIZZ follows the market standard, with the difference that it adds value in serving the producer.

      <h3>Personalized Service</h3>
      <h4>Social proof</h4>
      <p>
        FASTBIZZ is a platform that started just over a year ago. It already has more than ten active producers who earn higher revenue than they had before using the platform. As in any other business, the producer has a better chance of success if he is mentored by experts. The success of FASTBIZZ is in helping the producer to be successful in his own business.
